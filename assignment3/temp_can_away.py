def rnn_step_forward(x, prev_h, Wx, Wh, b):
  """
  Run the forward pass for a single timestep of a vanilla RNN that uses a tanh
  activation function.

  The input data has dimension D, the hidden state has dimension H, and we use
  a minibatch size of N.

  Inputs:
  - x: Input data for this timestep, of shape (N, D).
  - prev_h: Hidden state from previous timestep, of shape (N, H)
  - Wx: Weight matrix for input-to-hidden connections, of shape (D, H)
  - Wh: Weight matrix for hidden-to-hidden connections, of shape (H, H)
  - b: Biases of shape (H,)

  Returns a tuple of:
  - next_h: Next hidden state, of shape (N, H)
  - cache: Tuple of values needed for the backward pass.
